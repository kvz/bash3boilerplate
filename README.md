## Overview

<!--more-->

When hacking up Bash scripts, there are often things such as logging or command-line argument parsing that:

 - You need every time
 - Come with a number of pitfalls you want to avoid
 - Keep you from your actual work
 
Here's an attempt to bundle those things in a generalized way so that
they are reusable as-is in most scripts.

## Goals

Delete-Key-**Friendly**. We propose using [`main.sh`](http://bash3boilerplate.sh/main.sh) 
as a base and removing the parts you don't need, rather than introducing packages, includes, compilers, etc.
This may feel a bit archaic at first, but that is exactly the strength of Bash scripts that we want to embrace.

**Portable**. We're targeting Bash 3 (OSX still ships
with 3 for instance). If you're going to ask people to install
Bash 4 first, you might as well pick a more advanced language as a
dependency.

## Features

- Conventions so that after a while, all your scripts will follow the same, battle-tested structure
- Safe by default (break on error, pipefail, etc)
- Configuration by environment variables
- Simple command-line argument parsing that requires no external dependencies. Definitions are parsed from help info, so there is no duplication
- Helpful magic variables like `__file` and `__dir`
- Logging that supports colors and is compatible with [Syslog Severity levels](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Syslog#Severity_levels) as well as the [twelve-factor](http://12factor.net/) guidelines

## Who uses b3bp?

- [Transloadit](https://transloadit.com)
- [OpenCoarrays](http://www.opencoarrays.org)
- [Sourcery Institute](http://www.sourceryinstitute.org)
- [Computational Brain Anatomy Laboratory](http://cobralab.ca/)

We're looking for endorsement! Are you also using b3bp? [Let us know](https://github.com/kvz/bash3boilerplate/issues/new?title=I%20use%20b3bp) and get listed.

## Installation

There are 3 different ways you can install b3bp:

### option 1: Download the main template

Use curl or wget to download the source, save as your script, and start deleting the unwanted bits, and adding your own logic.

```bash
wget http://bash3boilerplate.sh/main.sh
vim main.sh
```

### option 2: Clone the entire project

Besides `main.sh`, this will get you the entire b3bp repository including a few extra functions that we keep in the `./src` directory.

```bash
git clone git@github.com:kvz/bash3boilerplate.git
```

### option 3: Require via npm

As of `v1.0.3`, b3bp can also be installed as a Node module so you can define it as a dependency in `package.json` via:

```bash
npm init
npm install --save --save-exact bash3boilerplate
```

Although this option introduces a Node.js dependency, this does allow for easy version pinning and distribution in environments that already have this prerequisite. But, this is optional and nothing prevents you from ignoring this possibility.

## Changelog

Please see the [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md) file.

## Best practices

As of `v1.0.3`, b3bp adds some nice re-usable libraries in `./src`. In order to make the snippets in `./src` more useful, we recommend these guidelines.

### Function packaging

It's nice to have a Bash package that can be used in the terminal and also be invoked as a command line function. To achieve this the exporting of your functionality *should* follow this pattern:

```bash
if [ "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}" != "${0}" ]; then
  export -f my_script
else
  my_script "${@}"
  exit $?
fi
```

This allows a user to `source` your script or invoke as a script.

```bash
# Running as a script
$ ./my_script.sh some args --blah
# Sourcing the script
$ source my_script.sh
$ my_script some more args --blah
```

### Scoping

1. In functions, use `local` before every variable declaration
1. Use `UPPERCASE_VARS` to indicate environment variables that can be controlled outside your script
1. Use `__double_underscore_prefixed_vars` to indicate global variables that are solely controlled inside your script, with the exception of arguments which are already prefixed with `arg_`, and functions, over which b3bp poses no restrictions.

### Coding style

1. Use two spaces for tabs
1. Use long options (`logger --priority` vs `logger -p`). If you're on cli, abbreviations make sense for efficiency. but when you're writing reusable scripts a few extra keystrokes will pay off in readability and avoid ventures into man pages in the future by you or your collaborators. Similarly, we prefer `set -o nounset` over `set -u`.
1. Use a single equal sign when checking `if [ "${NAME}" = "Kevin" ]`, double or triple signs are not needed.

### Safety and Portability

1. Use `{}` to enclose your variables in. Otherwise Bash will try to access the `$ENVIRONMENT_app` variable in `/srv/$ENVIRONMENT_app`, whereas you probably intended `/srv/${ENVIRONMENT}_app`. Since it's easy to miss cases like this, we recommend making enclosing a habit.
1. Use `set` rather than relying on a shebang like `#!/usr/bin/env bash -e` as that is neutralized when someone runs your script as `bash yourscript.sh`
1. Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` as it is more portable than `#!/bin/bash`.
1. Use `${BASH_SOURCE[0]}` if you refer to current file even if it is sourced by a parent script. Otherwise use `${0}`
1. Use `:-` if you want to test variables that could be undeclared. For instance with `if [ "${NAME:-}" = "Kevin" ]`, `$NAME` will evaluate to `Kevin` if the variable is empty. The variable itself will remain unchanged. The syntax to assign a default value is `${NAME:=Kevin}`.
