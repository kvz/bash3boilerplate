### BASH3 Boilerplate (b3bp) Header
##############################################################################

# Commandline options. This defines the usage page, and is used to parse cli
# opts & defaults from. The parsing is unforgiving so be precise in your syntax
# - A short option must be preset for every long option; but every short option
#   need not have a long option
# - `--` is respected as the separator between options and arguments
# - We do not bash-expand defaults, so setting '~/app' as a default will not resolve to ${HOME}.
#   you can use bash variables to work around this (so use ${HOME} instead)

# shellcheck disable=SC2034
read -r -d '' __usage <<-'EOF' || true # exits non-zero when EOF encountered
  -f --file  [arg] Filename to process. Required.
  -t --temp  [arg] Location of tempfile. Default="/tmp/bar"
  -v               Enable verbose mode, print script as it is executed
  -d --debug       Enables debug mode
  -h --help        This page
  -n --no-color    Disable color output
  -1 --one         Do just one thing
EOF

# shellcheck disable=SC2034
read -r -d '' __helptext <<-'EOF' || true # exits non-zero when EOF encountered
 This is Bash3 Boilerplate's help text. Feel free to add any description of your
 program or elaborate more on command-line arguments. This section is not
 parsed and will be added as-is to the help.
EOF

# shellcheck source=main.sh
source "$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)/main.sh"


### Signal trapping and backtracing
##############################################################################

function __b3bp_cleanup_before_exit () {
  info "Cleaning up. Done"
}
trap __b3bp_cleanup_before_exit EXIT

# requires `set -o errtrace`
__b3bp_err_report() {
    local error_code
    error_code=${?}
    # shellcheck disable=SC2154
    error "Error in ${__file} in function ${1} on line ${2}"
    exit ${error_code}
}
# Uncomment the following line for always providing an error backtrace
# trap '__b3bp_err_report "${FUNCNAME:-.}" ${LINENO}' ERR


### Command-line argument switches (like -d for debugmode, -h for showing helppage)
##############################################################################

# debug mode
if [[ "${arg_d:?}" = "1" ]]; then
  set -o xtrace
  LOG_LEVEL="7"
  # Enable error backtracing
  trap '__b3bp_err_report "${FUNCNAME:-.}" ${LINENO}' ERR
fi

# verbose mode
if [[ "${arg_v:?}" = "1" ]]; then
  set -o verbose
fi

# no color mode
if [[ "${arg_n:?}" = "1" ]]; then
  NO_COLOR="true"
fi

# help mode
if [[ "${arg_h:?}" = "1" ]]; then
  # Help exists with code 1
  help "Help using ${0}"
fi


### Validation. Error out if the things required for your script are not present
##############################################################################

[[ "${arg_f:-}" ]]     || help      "Setting a filename with -f or --file is required"
[[ "${LOG_LEVEL:-}" ]] || emergency "Cannot continue without LOG_LEVEL. "

debug "Info useful to developers for debugging the application, not useful during operations."
info "Normal operational messages - may be harvested for reporting, measuring throughput, etc. - no action required."
notice "Events that are unusual but not error conditions - might be summarized in an email to developers or admins to spot potential problems - no immediate action required."
warning "Warning messages, not an error, but indication that an error will occur if action is not taken, e.g. file system 85% full - each item must be resolved within a given time. This is a debug message"
error "Non-urgent failures, these should be relayed to developers or admins; each item must be resolved within a given time."
critical "Should be corrected immediately, but indicates failure in a primary system, an example is a loss of a backup ISP connection."
alert "Should be corrected immediately, therefore notify staff who can fix the problem. An example would be the loss of a primary ISP connection."
emergency "A \"panic\" condition usually affecting multiple apps/servers/sites. At this level it would usually notify all tech staff on call."
