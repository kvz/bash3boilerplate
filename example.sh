### BASH3 Boilerplate (b3bp) Header
##############################################################################

# Commandline options. This defines the usage page, and is used to parse cli
# opts & defaults from. The parsing is unforgiving so be precise in your syntax
# - A short option must be preset for every long option; but every short option
#   need not have a long option
# - `--` is respected as the separator between options and arguments
# - We do not bash-expand defaults, so setting '~/app' as a default will not resolve to ${HOME}.
#   you can use bash variables to work around this (so use ${HOME} instead)

read -r -d '' __usage <<-'EOF' || true # exits non-zero when EOF encountered
  -f --file  [arg] Filename to process. Required.
  -t --temp  [arg] Location of tempfile. Default="/tmp/bar"
  -v               Enable verbose mode, print script as it is executed
  -d --debug       Enables debug mode
  -h --help        This page
  -n --no-color    Disable color output
  -1 --one         Do just one thing
EOF

read -r -d '' __helptext <<-'EOF' || true # exits non-zero when EOF encountered
 This is Bash3 Boilerplate's help text. Feel free to add any description of your
 program or elaborate more on command-line arguments. This section is not
 parsed and will be added as-is to the help.
EOF

source "$(cd "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")" && pwd)/main.sh"


### Command-line argument switches (like -d for debugmode, -h for showing helppage)
##############################################################################

# debug mode
if [ "${arg_d}" = "1" ]; then
  set -o xtrace
  LOG_LEVEL="7"
fi

# verbose mode
if [ "${arg_v}" = "1" ]; then
  set -o verbose
fi

# no color mode
if [ "${arg_n}" = "1" ]; then
  NO_COLOR="true"
fi

# help mode
if [ "${arg_h}" = "1" ]; then
  # Help exists with code 1
  help "Help using ${0}"
fi


### Validation. Error out if the things required for your script are not present
##############################################################################

[ -z "${LOG_LEVEL:-}" ] && emergency "Cannot continue without LOG_LEVEL. "

alert "Should be corrected immediately, therefore notify staff who can fix the problem. An example would be the loss of a primary ISP connection."
emergency "A \"panic\" condition usually affecting multiple apps/servers/sites. At this level it would usually notify all tech staff on call."
